# Infix Expression Evaluator - Calculator

The application takes input of an infix expression value that has to be real numbers. The value is calculated following order of operations
and calculates a final value. A couple of examples are provided in the resources' folder to show easy to use example.

## Getting Started

The project is built using Java so using any IDE that supports Java will work and can be used to create a .jar file to run in the desktop. 
For the application to work you will need to use correctly formatted infix expression with real number values and that will be used to calculate
the final value in the result field.
